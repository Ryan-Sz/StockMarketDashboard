# StockMarketDashboard
Final milestone dashboard for Dash course written in Python 3.7.3

## What does it do?
Reads stock data from an online exchange based on the ticker and dates chosen. Displays stock data, and simulates realistic stock value trajectories 20 days in the future with Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations added together to form a histogram/probability density of future stock price.

## Requisites
Dash, Plotly, Pandas DataReader, Dash Auth.
N.B. Pandas DataReader is a bit unreliable, may have to change exchanges at times. Yahoo working for now.

## To Run in Command Prompt
python DashMilestone3.py
